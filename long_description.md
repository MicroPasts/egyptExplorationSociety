This application enables the transcription of archive cards from the Egypt Exploration Society's 1930 - 1931 season at
Amarna. Images will be drawn from the EES Flickr feed and redisplayed in the browser window. They would like the following
information to be transcribed for them to create a searchable archive for their records. These fields are:

* Title
* Object number
* Negative number
* Provenance
* Distribution
* Other notes
* Annotations (if any).

This should be a very straight forward and easy application and comprises of just under 700 images.
